# JUWAP
##  A PETREL Plugin Creating Statistical Reports

I developed JUWAP (A PETREL Plugin) using the ocean framework in C# to help engineers analyze statistical data and perform economic calculations.
In this way, the user is able to analyze large eclipse print files quickly, filter the results, and create reports from an implemented report gallery or create customized reports interactively. The results can easily be exported to an Excel file.

The interface of the plugin is shown below:
